                    <strong>Coffee means a lot to us - but that's not all! We are also passionate about other hot and cold drinks, pastries, sandwiches and salads.</strong>
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    <strong>We make your favorite meal every day with knowledge, love and the best ingredients of the season.</strong>

                <h2><strong>Cold Drinks</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    With us you will find not only hot coffee, but also a large selection of cold drinks. In addition to cold drinks in bottles, we have our own mixes that we make while you wait. In the summer heat we can recommend you to try one of our iced teas, frapinos or iced tea! If you want a fresh and healthy alternative, we can tempt you with our smoothies, made with natural ingredients. Welcome in and find your favorite!
                </p>
                <h2><strong>Hot drinks</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    We love coffee more than anything else. With us you will find several exciting flavor combinations based on our own Coffee House. We have more on the menu than just good coffee - we serve, for example, cocoa made with a combo of Belgian dark and milk chocolate. The big favorite chai latte never fails and you can choose between 5 different teas. You do not have to love coffee to find something good with us!
                </p>
                <h2><strong>Food</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    We want to offer something for every occasion, and you will find more than just coffee and cakes with us. We have many good salads, yogurts, cold and hot sandwiches and much more good. We lubricate all food ourselves to ensure the best possible freshness on our products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is very important that we serve high quality products, and therefore we receive goods from a number of local suppliers. Among these you will find Str√∏m-Larsen and Vestfold Fugl, who both deliver high quality meat. Try, for example, our good Caesar salad, made with juicy chicken from Vestfold Bird.
